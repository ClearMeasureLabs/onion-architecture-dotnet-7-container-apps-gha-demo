@REM 5.1.2 in creating the Subscription Software, we have not knowingly infringed
@REM the intellectual property rights of third parties; and
@REM 5.1.3 for a period of 90 days from the first installation of the Subscription
@REM Software (or, if applicable, 90 days from the end of the Evaluation Period if you continue
@REM to use the Subscription Software) the Subscription Software shall operate substantially in
@REM accordance with its description. However, you acknowledge that the Subscription
@REM Software is of such a complexity that there will be inherent defects and that therefore we
@REM can give no warranty that the Subscription Software is free from error or defect or that
@REM operation of the Subscription Software shall be uninterrupted.
@REM 5.2 Other than as provided for in clauses 5.1 and 10.8.2(i), we do not offer any warranty
@REM related to the Subscription Software and/or the support provided, either express or
@REM implied, including but not limited to implied warranties of fitness for purpose or
@REM satisfactory quality, save for any non-excludable rights and remedies you may have
@REM under law. The Subscription Software has been developed as a standard product for use
@REM by a wide variety of users and so we are unable to warrant that the Subscription
@REM Software will meet any particular user needs. You shall take full responsibility for
@REM ensuring that the Subscription Software is suitable for your intended purposes and to
@REM facilitate investigation into such suitability, we offer a free Evaluation Period.
@REM 5.3 Support. In relation to and without prejudice to the generality of clause 5.2 above, we
@REM provide support to users of Subscription Software via our web site, user forums, by email
@REM and by phone. The support is provided subject to the terms of this Agreement. You
@REM accept that, although we will use reasonable endeavours to solve problems identified by
@REM you, the nature of software is such that no guarantee can be provided that any particular
@REM problem will be solved. You accept that, where a particular problem requires an update
@REM to the Subscription Software, the scheduling of any new releases and the functionality
@REM those releases contain shall be under our sole control.
@REM 6 LIMITATION AND EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY
@REM 6.1 Nothing in this Agreement shall limit or exclude either party's liability for: (a) personal

@REM statutory duty, restitution or otherwise). We shall not be liable to you for any of the
@REM following types of loss or damage arising under or in relation to this Agreement: (a) any

@REM the Subscription Fees paid in the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the liability.
@REM 6.4 The provisions of this clause allocate risks under this Agreement between you and us,

@REM 7 SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD, TERMINATION AND RETIRED SOFTWARE
@REM 7.1 The Subscription shall commence on the Subscription Start Date and, unless terminated
@REM earlier in accordance with this clause 7, shall continue for the Initial Subscription Period
@REM and, thereafter, the Subscription shall be automatically renewed for successive periods
@REM of 12 months (each a "Renewal Period"), unless either party notifies the other party of
@REM termination, in writing, at least 30 days before the end of the Initial Subscription Period or
@REM any Renewal Period, in which case the Subscription shall terminate upon the expiry of
@REM the applicable Initial Subscription Period or Renewal Period.
@REM 7.2 If we do not receive the Subscription Fee or the relevant Renewal Fee from you, we
@REM reserve the right to terminate your Subscription 30 days after the payment due date.

@REM Software to us, and notify us that you have done so.
@REM 7.4 Where the Subscription is terminated in accordance with clause 7.4 or clause 7.3, then
@REM the Agreement shall terminate in its entirety.
@REM 7.5 Upon termination of this Agreement: (a) you must cease use of the Subscription
@REM Software, and uninstall, destroy or put beyond use all copies of the Subscription
@REM Software in your possession or control; and (b) the provisions of clauses 1.5, 4, 5.2, 6, 7,
@REM 9, 10.1 to 10.7 and 11 will remain in effect.
@REM 7.6 The termination of this Agreement howsoever arising shall not affect the rights, duties
@REM and liabilities of either party accrued prior to termination.
@REM 7.7 Retired Software. We reserve the right to retire the Subscription Software (and

@REM 8 DATA COLLECTION AND PRIVACY NOTICE
@REM 8.1 Information on the data we collect about you and how we treat that data is set out in our

@REM 9 THIRD PARTY CLAIMS
@REM 9.1 You agree to indemnify us from any loss or damage whether in contract, tort (including

@REM your use of the Subscription Software causes any such loss or damage, except in the
@REM circumstances in clause 9.2 below.
@REM 9.2 If any claim is brought against you alleging that your use of the intellectual property
@REM associated with the Subscription Software in accordance with this Agreement infringes
@REM the rights of any third party, you shall promptly notify us and supply full details of the
@REM claim. The two of us shall consult together on an appropriate course of action and seek
@REM to minimise the effect of any claim on the respective businesses. We shall have the right,
@REM but not the obligation, to take control of all negotiations and litigation arising out of the
@REM claim. We will pay any damages and costs awarded against you in connection with any
@REM claim subject to a maximum of the aggregate sum of Subscription Fees paid to us by you
@REM in the 12 months prior to the claim. We shall have the right, at our sole choice, to either:
@REM (i) use reasonable endeavours to negotiate terms for continued use by you of the
@REM claimed infringing software; or (ii) use reasonable endeavours to amend the Subscription
@REM Software to make it non-infringing; or (iii) terminate this Agreement with immediate effect
@REM and in such event, we shall refund to you all Subscription Fees paid.
@REM 10 GENERAL
@REM 10.1 Governing law and settlement of disputes. This Agreement (and any dispute or
@REM claim relating to it, or its formation, existence, construction, performance, validity or
@REM termination) will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England.
@REM The courts of England and Wales shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction to settle any
@REM dispute or claim arising out of or in connection with this agreement or its subject matter
@REM or formation (including non-contractual disputes or claims). Without prejudice to any
@REM other rights or remedies that we may have, you acknowledge and agree that damages
@REM alone would not be an adequate remedy for any breach of clauses 1, 2, 4 and/or
@REM Schedule 2 by you. Accordingly, we shall be entitled to seek an injunction or other
@REM equitable relief for any threatened or actual breach of those clauses.
@REM 10.2 Compliance with applicable law. You agree that, notwithstanding clause 10.1 above,
@REM you may be subject to additional laws in other jurisdictions with respect to your use of the
@REM Subscription Software in such jurisdictions. You agree to comply with the laws of any
@REM such jurisdiction including, without limitation, any applicable export laws or regulations.
@REM 10.3 Severability. If any provision or part of any provision in this Agreement is found to be
@REM illegal, invalid or unenforceable for any reason then the remaining provisions or part
@REM provisions remain unaffected and the parties shall meet promptly to discuss in good faith
@REM and agree an alternative provision or part provision that provides as closely as possible,
@REM the same commercial effect as the original.
@REM 10.4 No waiver. No failure or delay by any party to exercise any right, power or remedy will
@REM operate as a waiver of it, nor will any partial exercise preclude any further exercise of the
@REM same, or of some other right, power or remedy.
@REM 10.5 No third party rights. We and you do not intend that any of this Agreement will be
@REM enforceable by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 by any person
@REM not a party to it and all rights by virtue of the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999
@REM are hereby excluded.
@REM 10.6 Entire agreement. This Agreement contains all the terms which the parties have
@REM agreed in relation to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes any prior oral
@REM agreements, representations or understandings between the parties in relation to such
@REM subject matter.
@REM 10.7 Revisions to terms. For click to agree versions of the Agreement only, we reserve the
@REM right to revise the terms of this Agreement by updating this Agreement on our website.
@REM You are advised to check the website periodically for notices concerning such revisions.
@REM If you do not agree with any such revision you may terminate your agreement within 10
@REM days of the relevant revision without liability to us. Your continued use of the
@REM Subscription Software shall be deemed to constitute acceptance of any revised terms.
@REM No revisions will apply retrospectively. Any bespoke versions of this Agreement shall
@REM continue to apply to all future downloads or installation of Software and shall always take
@REM precedence over any click to agree versions presented at download or installation of
@REM such Software.
@REM 10.8 Consumer regulations.
@REM 10.8.1 This clause applies to Consumers only. You shall have the right to cancel this
@REM Agreement 14 days from the date you agree to be obliged to pay for the Subscription
@REM Software under this Agreement. Should you wish to cancel this Agreement under this
@REM clause 10.8, you must notify us of your decision to cancel by either: (a) returning a

@REM 10.8.2 Australian consumer law
@REM (i) Despite clause 5 our goods and services come with guarantees that cannot be excluded
@REM under the Australian Consumer Law. For major failures with the service, you are
@REM entitled; (i) to cancel your service contract with us; and (ii) to a refund for the unused
@REM portion, or to compensation for its reduced value. You are also entitled to choose a
@REM refund or replacement for major failures with goods. If a failure with the goods or a
@REM service does not amount to a major failure, you are entitled to have the failure rectified in
@REM a reasonable time. If this is not done you are entitled to a refund for the goods and to
@REM cancel the contract for the service and obtain a refund of any unused portion. You are
@REM also entitled to be compensated for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage
@REM from a failure in the goods or service. If you think that the Subscription Software does
@REM not operate substantially in accordance with its description within the warranty period
@REM specified in clause 5.1.3, and you wish to make a claim under the warranty in clause
@REM 5.1.3, you must contact us using the relevant contact details:
@REM https//www.red-gate.com/our-company/contact-us and provide details of how you think
@REM that the Subscription Software does not meet that warranty in clause 5.1.3.
@REM (ii) Despite clause 6 and any other provision in this Agreement, if the Competition and
@REM Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (including the Australian Consumer Law in Schedule 2 of that
@REM Act) provides that there is a guarantee in relation to any good or service supplied by us
@REM in connection with this Agreement, and our liability for failing to comply with that
@REM guarantee cannot be excluded but may be limited, then clauses 6.2, 6.3 and clause 3 of
@REM Schedule 1 and any other limitation of our liability in this Agreement, do not apply to that
@REM liability and instead our liability for such failure is limited to (at our election: (i) in the case
@REM of a supply of goods, replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods, or paying the
@REM cost of having the goods repaired; or (ii) in the case of a supply of services, supplying
@REM the services again or paying the cost of having the services supplied again.
